To run the program, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If not, you can download and install them from the official Node.js website.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the root directory of the project using the `cd` command. For example, if the project is located in `C:\Projects\my-app`, run `cd C:\Projects\my-app` to navigate to that directory.
5. Install the project dependencies by running the following command: `npm install` or `npm i`
   This command will install all the necessary dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.
6. Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with the following command: `npx vite`
   This command will compile the project and start the development server.
7. Open your web browser and visit the specified local development URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) to see the running application.

Note: 
- Before running the commands, ensure that your project is properly set up with the required dependencies and configuration files. 
- Modify the instructions according to your project's specific requirements and structure.
